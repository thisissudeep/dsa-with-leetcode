# DSA with LeetCode

This is my personal repository of **Data Structures & Algorithms** problems solved primarily using **Java**, and occasionally **Python**. This repo is a curated collection of solutions from **LeetCode**, categorized by difficulty.

## Folder Structure

```
dsa-with-leetcode
 | easy/
 | | 1. Two Sum.md
 | | 1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String.md
 | medium/
 | hard/
```

Each folder (`easy/`, `medium/`, `hard/`) corresponds to the LeetCode problem difficulty level. Inside each folder, problems are saved in markdown files named using the format:

```
<problem-number>. <problem-title>.md
```

Each file includes:

- Problem Question
- Java and/or Python solution

## Languages Used

- **Java** — Primary language used
- **Python** — For select problems or alternative solutions

## Goal

- Optimize solutions with clean code and scalable logic

## Topics Covered

- Arrays & Strings
