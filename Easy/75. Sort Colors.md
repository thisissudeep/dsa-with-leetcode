Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]

 

Constraints:

    n == nums.length
    1 <= n <= 300
    nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.
## Code:
- Using Buuble Sort

``` java
class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        bubbleSort(nums);
    }


public void bubbleSort(int[] nums)   //iterate the bubble until sorting(move large to last)
    {
        int end=nums.length-1;
        while(end!=0)
        {
            int i=0;
            int j=1;
            while(!(j>end))
            {
                if(nums[i]>nums[j])
                {
                    int temp=nums[i];
                    nums[i]=nums[j];
                    nums[j]=temp;
                }
                i++;
                j++;
            }
            end--;
        }
    }
}
```
```
